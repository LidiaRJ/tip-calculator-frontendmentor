## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

I added a sound effect to the buttons in the app implementing a function in JS and applying an event on the HTML markup.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Sass precompiler


### What I learned

I learn how to build functions and select buttons under a same class using forEach and addEventListener. 
This project helped me understand JavaScript logic better and feel more confident. 




### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- Stack over flow, W3School, github and freeCodeCamp articles have been really help to understand the JS structure when building an app and writing functions.
